1. resist writing in a conversational tone; provide specifics where possible, e.g., accuracy declined by 2.5% when data compressed by 1000%; increasing training time from 3 minutes to 30 minutes only improved accuracy from 90% to 92%.

2. practice to write "defensively". This is analogous to driving defensively. Be aware of the claims that you are making, and make sure that they are precise and defensible. It is better to err on making a narrower claim than one that may be challenged by the reviewers. 

Also, you should always assume that the authors of the referenced papers will also be the reviewers of the paper, [..] when you describe the shortcomings of a cited work, you should feel confident of making that same criticism while you are standing up in a full room, with the authors of the cited work in the room.

The figure also raises a question for me: why is it that most of the accuracy loss occurs from 60s to 50s, particularly for larger bin-sizes?
