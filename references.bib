	abstract = {{AbstractObjectives}
Brain–computer interfaces ({BCIs)} are no longer only used by healthy participants under controlled conditions in laboratory environments, but also by patients and end-users, controlling applications in their homes or clinics, without the {BCI} experts around. But are the technology and the field mature enough for this? Especially the successful operation of applications – like text entry systems or assistive mobility devices such as tele-presence robots – requires a good level of {BCI} control. How much training is needed to achieve such a level? Is it possible to train naïve end-users in 10 days to successfully control such applications?
Materials and methods
In this work, we report our experiences of training 24 motor-disabled participants at rehabilitation clinics or at the end-users’ homes, without {BCI} experts present. We also share the lessons that we have learned through transferring {BCI} technologies from the lab to the user's home or clinics.
Results
The most important outcome is that 50\% of the participants achieved good {BCI} performance and could successfully control the applications (tele-presence robot and text-entry system). In the case of the tele-presence robot the participants achieved an average performance ratio of 0.87 (max. 0.97) and for the text entry application a mean of 0.93 (max. 1.0). The lessons learned and the gathered user feedback range from pure {BCI} problems (technical and handling), to common communication issues among the different people involved, and issues encountered while controlling the applications.
Conclusion
The points raised in this paper are very widely applicable and we anticipate that they might be faced similarly by other groups, if they move on to bringing the {BCI} technology to the end-user, to home environments and towards application prototype control.},

The brain-computer interface ({BCI)} would allow humans to operate computers, wheelchairs, prostheses, and other devices, using brain signals only. {BCI} research may someday provide a communication channel for patients with severe physical disabilities but intact cognitive functions, a working tool in computational neuroscience that contributes to a better understanding of the brain, and a novel independent interface for human-machine communication that offers new options for monitoring and control. This volume presents a timely overview of the latest {BCI} research, with contributions from many of the important research groups in the field. The book covers a broad range of topics, describing work on both noninvasive (that is, without the implantation of electrodes) and invasive approaches. Other chapters discuss relevant techniques from machine learning and signal processing, existing software for {BCI}, and possible applications of {BCI} research in the real world.},

This work intends to build a user-friendly, self-paced Brain-Computer Interface ({BCI)} system that allows using commercial {EEG} headsets in order to drive an electrical wheelchair with a motor imagery approach. Furthermore, the conceived system has been used for a first evaluation of a commercial, low-cost, {EEG} device compared with data coming from a professional device. The result shows that the low cost {EEG} device, at the actual state of the art, provide interesting results but can hardly be used for self-paced systems in error sensitive context.},

With this proof-of-concept phase in the past, the time is now ripe to focus on the development of practical {BCI} technologies that can be brought out of the lab and into real-world applications. In particular, we focus on the prospect of improving the lives of countless disabled individuals through a combination of {BCI} technology with existing assistive technologies ({AT).} In pursuit of more practical {BCIs} for use outside of the lab, in this paper, we identify four application areas where disabled individuals could greatly benefit from advancements in {BCI} technology, namely, {"Communication} and Control", {"Motor} Substitution", {"Entertainment"}, and {"Motor} Recovery". We review the current state of the art and possible future developments, while discussing the main research issues in these four areas. In particular, we expect the most progress in the development of technologies such as hybrid {BCI} architectures, user-machine adaptation algorithms, the exploitation of users' mental states for {BCI} reliability and confidence measures, the incorporation of principles in human-computer interaction ({HCI)} to improve {BCI} usability, and the development of novel {BCI} technology including better {EEG} devices.},

Since the characteristics of such direct brain-to-computer interaction are limited in several aspects, one major challenge in {BCI} research is intelligent front-end design. Here we present the mental text entry application {‘Hex-o-Spell’} which incorporates principles of Human-Computer Interaction research into {BCI} feedback design. The system utilises the high visual display bandwidth to help compensate for the extremely limited control bandwidth which operates with only two mental states, where the timing of the state changes encodes most of the information. The display is visually appealing, and control is robust. The effectiveness and robustness of the interface was demonstrated at the {CeBIT} 2006 (world’s largest {IT} fair) where two subjects operated the mental text entry system at a speed of up to 7.6 char/min.},
