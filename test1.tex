% \abstract{Physiological computing applications generally require calibrating a classification algorithm, as biosignals vary widely from user to user. However, as these applications shift from lab-based prototypes into consumer products, developers need to optimize for more than classification accuracy: systems must also calibrate quickly to their users, support low-cost, ergonomic sensing equipment, and run efficiently on low-power, mobile devices. 

\abstract{This paper exhibits two methods for decreasing the time associated with training a machine learning classifier on biometric signals. Using electroencephalography (EEG) data obtained from a consumer-grade headset with a single electrode, we show that these methods produce significant gains in computational performance and calibration time of a simple brain-computer interface (BCI) without significantly decreasing accuracy. We discuss the relevance of reduced feature vector size to the design of physiological computing applications.}

% By combining logarithmic quantization of spectral signals with a progressive calibration strategy, 

% With a novel signal quantization method, we increase the computational speed associated with training a machine learning classifier 450\% without significant detriment to the BCI's accuracy. 

% We demonstrate a progressive calibration strategy that, in conjunction with our quantization method, achieves high accuracy in most subjects with under 12 minutes of training data. 


% \abstract{Physiological signals vary widely between persons, and even within individuals over time. As a result, applications with physiological inputs usually require repeated calibration. Application designers face a tradeoff between computational complexity, calibration time, and classification accuracy. In this paper, we describe a data quantization technique that increases the computational speed associated with calibrating of power spectrum time series data. We test this technique on electroencephalograph (EEG) signals by simulating the calibration of a binary brain-computer interface (BCI). We find that we can increase the computational speed associated with training a machine-learning based classifier 4.5 times without a significant detriment to the system's accuracy. A progressive calibration strategy achieves high accuracy in 86.6\% of subjects with under five minutes of quantized training data, in all but one subject with under fifteen minutes and in all subjects with under half an hour. We discuss implications for consumer BCI devices and for physiological computing applications generally.}
