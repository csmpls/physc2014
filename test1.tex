\abstract{Physiological computing applications rely on time series data from sensors, which vary widely between users and over time. Application designers face a tradeoff between computational complexity, calibration time, and classification accuracy. We describe a novel quantization technique for EEG signals, which we find increases the computational speed associated with training a machine-learning based classifier without a significant detriment to system accuracy. We test this technique on a brain-computer interface (BCI), and find that an opportunistic calibration strategy can achieve acceptable accuracy in 86.6\% of subjects with under five minutes of training. We discuss implications for the design of consumer-ready BCI and other physiological computing applications.}
