we hypothesize a lower average accuracy than the baseline method, because ite will sometimes find local optima


making the process by with we deal with that nonstationarity smoother?   making physiological data easier to work with overall?   like, the mp3 of physiological data?    and we're showing its just as good for our use case, implies maybe in many other use cases too?

dont be afriad to dis calibration time / sensor # directly in intro



we preserve data that isnt neural activity - more general physiological signals

should talk about how neurosky cleans their data............black box heh   call the guy
