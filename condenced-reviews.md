However, one point is not clear: what is the main motivation of this paper: to improve both SVM effectiveness and efficiency, or to improve the signal classification itself? SVM is just a technique in this context? Please, make this point clear.

6.	The experiment on sect. 5 is not completely understood. SVM is a binary classifier, so the two best gestures are chosen, from 21 possible combinations. *But if each subjectâ€™s data is classified based on different classes, then how can the results between various subjects be comparable and consequently support the conclusions? And what happens to the remaining 5 classes in each case?* Please revise this part by answering the above questions and by providing a more *clear and sequential description of the process. 

1. missing letters from words, in Fig. 6.    go over all words with a fine-toothed com

1. The blank in the first sentence of Section 3 should be removed. 

2. In Figure 1, the number of the red squares representing the 100 bins is less than 100. It should match the introduction in the paper. 

3. There lacks the comparison results with the existing methods in the experimental parts.
