\section{\uppercase{Dataset}}

The data used in this experiment were taken from a previous study. The anonymized dataset consists of power spectrum time series data recorded by the software from the Neurosky MindSet headset from 15 subjects, who were students at UC Berkeley, performing mental tasks. Participants performed each of the seven mental tasks, enumerated below, ten times. Each of the ten trials lasted ten seconds.

The seven mental tasks were: focusing on breathing; imagining moving one's right index finger; imagining moving one's body to repeatedly perform a sports-related movement of the subject's choice; imagining singing a song or reciting a passage; listening to a tone with eyes closed; choosing a color (red; green; yellow or blue) and counting how many times one's chosen color appears on a screen; choosing any thought to use as a ``password''.
