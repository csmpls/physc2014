We ran an ordinary least squares regression on number of bins and classifier accuracy at recording lengths of four seconds. Number of bins was positively correlated with classifier accuracy, with each bin correpsonding to 1.13\% gain in accuracy (R-squared = .773, p \textless .001). 

We ran an additional ordinary least squares regression on number of bins in the EEG data and the time it takes to train an SVM on those data, again at recordings of four seconds. Number of bins was positively correlated with time to train classifier (slope = 0.5 R-squared = .947, p \textless .001).

Since bin size has a linear relationship with both accuracy and SVM training time, we compare accuracy and training time directly in Figure 1.

\subsection{Experiment 2}

\begin{figure}[!h]
  \vspace{-0.2cm}
  \centering

  \caption{Mean best-case accuracy compared to number of seconds of data in training set.}
  \label{fig:fig2}

\end{figure}

When using 0.5-second recordings to train the SVM, we found no evidence of a significant difference in SVM accuracy at bin sizes ranging from 20 to 500.

\textcolor{red}{\bf still wondering how to report these results.... no statistically significant difference in time-to-calibrate, and very rarely is there a statistically significant difference in the post-calibration accuracy.... }.
