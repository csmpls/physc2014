\section{\uppercase{Introduction}}
\label{sec:introduction}

\noindent Physiological data do not carry universal meanings. While the movement of a computer mouse maps straightforwardly to the position of a cursor, the expression of bio-signals varies widely between individuals, and can change within individuals over time. Brain-computer interface (BCI) serves as a good example of this phenomenon: regular calibration and re-calibration are essential due to the personal and non-stationary nature of neural signals \cite{dornhege_toward_2007,mcfarland_brain-computer_2011}.

Supervised learning algorithms have enabled systems to adapt to users' personal physiology after a calibration period. In BCI, this approach has yielded proof-of-concept systems ranging from brain-controlled keyboards and wheelchairs to prosthetic arms and hands \cite{blankertz_note_2007,millan_combining_2010,d._mattia_brain_2011,hill_practical_2014,campbell_neurophone:_2010}. 

% For similar devices to find use outside of the lab, they  minimize both the size of our sensing devices and the amount of time users spend calibrating the interface. % minimal number of sensors + limited computational power on mobile devices % while still accurate and quick-to-calibrate

% BCIs often require upward of an hour to calibrate to their users, with close supervision by researchers, and may require regular recalibration due to the nonstationary nature of EEG signals. \cite{vidaurre_fully_2006,vidaurre_co-adaptive_2011,blankertz_non-invasive_2007} Recent work has come close to eliminating traditional calibration, though these techniques have not yet been applied to consumer headsets. \cite{kindermans_true_2014}

However, to move this work from laboratory settings into the real world, systems must work with mobile sensing equipment and wearable computing platforms. Mobile device architectures will limit the system's computational complexity compared to lab-based models, and ergonomic considerations will limit the number and quality of sensors on the device. As an added challange, systems should not require hours of calibration time to work properly.

% This leads us to pose the following research question: how fast and with how little computational power can we build a practical BCI?

In this study, we use signals acquired from a low-cost, mobile electroencephalograph (EEG) device with a single electrode to simulate a simple brain-computer interface. We study how the processing of physiological signals and the strategy for user calibration can impact the performance, reliability and calibration time of a bio-signal classification system. How can we characterize the tradeoff between computational complexity and classification accuracy at the signal processing step? Is it possible to achieve user calibration on the order of minutes rather than hours or days?

%How can we process EEG signals such that we minimize the computational expense of classification while maximizing the system's accuracy? Is a computationally efficient signal processing technique compatible with a user-calibration protocol that achieves ``BCI literacy'' across all subjects on the order of minutes rather than hours or days?

We propose a novel signal quantization technique that applies logarithmic binning to power spectrum data from a single EEG electrode. We find that this technique can increase the computational speed of a classification-based BCI 450\% compared to uncompressed data without significant detriment to system accuracy. In conjunction with a progressive user-calibration protocol, in which candidate mental gestures are tested ``on demand'' in order to minimize calibration time, we calibrate 86.6\% of users to a threshold of BCI control in under five minutes of training data, in all but one subject in under twelve minutes, and in 100\% of users in under half an hour. 

This paper is organized as follows. We discuss related works in Section \ref{sec:related}, and provide a summary of the dataset in Section \ref{sec:data}. We describe our signal quantization method in Section \ref{sec:quantization}, and quantify its effect on classifier speed and accuracy in Section \ref{sec:quantization_eval}. We evaluate a user calibration strategy in Section \ref{sec:calibration_eval} before concluding.
